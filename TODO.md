    * A system intertwined with your players stats that dwindles your strength as you slowly lose sanity
        * Regain sanity by
            * Eating remedies
            * Reading lore scraps
            * Doing random things (pet the grass, admire your sword)


## Ideas




### Code
* Create a Prefab system to clear up code base
* Similarly create a macro system


## Completed
* ~~Add a sprite base class~~
* ~~Capatilize all classes~~
* ~~Create good spriting (grouping) system that contains functions and sprite groups for specialized game sprites~~
* ~~Create a Game Map system with a good level system that allows levels to connect to each other, levels to load minimal save data about them, and levels that can be interchanged so the game object can read them.~~
*  ~~Give font names meaning like a css sheet so they are more easily changeable and self-explanatory `'hud-playerStats-list': . . .`~~
