TODO: Complete the Game


Game Design: 
    There was an initial lack of attention given to the game design that resulted in unvaried combat
    and a general aimlessness in the current product of the game which means we gotta supe this boy up!!

    For varying combat I will be adding more flying creatures and turret-like creatures so that dungeon crawling
    feels like a thrilling combination of sword combat, bullet hell, and dodging.

    I am going to be maximizing difficulty by fine-tuning the player's stats to be punishing but making upgrades
    more rewarding

Code:
    Finish light shaders
    Stats system
    Working saving system
    Working states
    Menu transitions
    Effects
        Explosion particles
