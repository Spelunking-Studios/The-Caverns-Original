# TODO: Complete the fricking Game


## Notes: 

    
   There was an initial lack of attention given to the game design that resulted in unvaried combat
   and a general aimlessness in the current product of the game which means we gotta supe this boy up!!

   For varying combat I will be adding more flying creatures and turret-like creatures so that dungeon crawling
   feels like a thrilling combination of sword combat, bullet hell, and dodging.

   I am going to be maximizing difficulty by fine-tuning the player's stats to be punishing but making upgrades
   more rewarding
